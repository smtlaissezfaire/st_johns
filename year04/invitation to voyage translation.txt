Invitation to Voyage

  My child, my sister,
  Dream of the sweetness
Of going there to live together!
  To Love at one's leisure,
  To Love and to die
In the country which resembles you!
  The wet suns
  Of those muddy skies
Have charms for my spirit 
  So mysterious,
  Of your trecherous eyes
Shining through their tears.

There, all is nothing but order and beauty
Luxury, calm and voluptuous.

  Of shining furniture,
  Polished by the years
Decorated our room;
  The most rare flowers
  Mix their odors
With the vague scents of amber.
  The rich ceilings,
  The deep mirrors, 
The Oriental splendor.
  There all spoke
  To the soul in secret
In its sweet native language.

There, all is nothing but order and beauty
Luxury, calm and voluptuous.

  See on these canals
  these sleeping vessels
Whose mood is a wandering one;
  It is in order to satisfy 
  Your smallest desire
That they come from the ends of the earth.
  - The setting sun
  Coats the fields,
The canals, the whole city
  With hyacinth and gold;
  The world falls asleep
In a warm light.

There, all is nothing but order and beauty
Luxury, calm and voluptuous.
