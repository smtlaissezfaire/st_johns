Mr. Nambiar,

This is not so much an outline as it is notes on the subject.  Of course, don't worry about spelling and that sort of thing.  I hope that you can get the general gist of what I'm trying to aim for, as I haven't fully explained everything.  So my goal is to just get some basic feedback on the topic, and if you think the topic is too broad, etc.


Best Regards,


Scott





topic: justice, mystical unity - in other words, man's mysterious relationship to god and in what way he is made in his image

sources: dante, creation story, plotinus, possibly a little augustine, possibly a little aquinas


why create?
	- couldn't be out of an inadequacy
	- could create either predetermined or with free will
		-if with free will, why?  for praise? that would be inadequacy
		-why not robotic? yet we don't hold this to be so  
	- plotinus(?)
	-"The serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal the the lord god had made."
		how could the devil (complete evil) come out of god?
			


creation story - interest arises with man and his fall
	
	-the garden is created with the tree of life  the tree of knowledge of good and evil
	- "you may freely eat of every tree of the garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die."
	-Then the Lord god said, "it is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner." god created the animals and the birds, "for the man there was not found a helper as his partner"
	-eve created out of adam's flesh

	-"But the serpent said to the woman, "you will not die; for god knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like god, knowing good and evil."
		-Has god lied to Adam & Eve?  Or are both God & The Devil true, but in different ways
			i.e. devil: live forever, true, because soul is immortal, and like god, for god says this later on
			god: life on earth is now limited
	-"then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves."
		-suggesting that without god we are naked - we have nothing, and so we feel we need to cover it with reason
	-god: "who told you that you were naked" - implying no distinction earlier (between being with & without god) in the minds of adam & eve
	-"See the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil, and now, he must reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever - therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden...he drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of eden he placed the charubin and a sword flaming and turning to guard the way to the tree of life."
		-what is the tree of life? What's its function in the story
		-who is the "us" when God speaks of himself?  Angels, trinity?


justice - several injustices and hence mysteries come out of this story (for we hold god to not be injust):

	-why would god intentionally put the tree in the garden? bible passage: do not tempt god - isn't he doing this to us?
		-maybe part of his plan?  Maybe the original sin is a good thing?
	-god created us as wanting knowledge, otherwise eve wouldn't desire to know.  aristotle: "to be learning something is the greatest of pleasure not only to the philosopher but also to the rest of mankind." (1448b10-15, poetics), "man desires to know" (metaphysics)
		-this seems unjust because it seems something driven in to all men by god
		-why is the tree the tree of the knowledge of good & evil?  Why not the tree of good & evil? Can you be blamed for doing something when you are unaware of it being bad?  Does the tree of life factor in here?
			knowledge vs. the good/the one -> plotinus connection
			the real sin may not have been knowing, but wanting to be like god (they must have already been like god, for they were made in his image).  They weren't content with the unknowable, and needed to be certain.

	-man created with the ability to sin? i.e. free in terms of will
		-the evil wasn't built in to man from the start, but rather only built into him after the fall.  Then again, did they acquire evil from the garden?  Why should knowledge of evil cause casting out?  Did they also acquire evil by having this knowledge?

	-the concept of original sin condeming us - how can I be condemned for someone elses mistakes?
		-the only way to make sense of this is to say it is built in to our nature
			-but how is this just?
			-man desiring to know, hence he took the fruit off the tree
		-could also suggest a percieved duality that is a oneness that exists with all of mankind, and possibly with god (consider the first line "our" suggesting unity of everything)
			-also possibly with god: think of unity of will of augustine
			-reason for journey through hell & pergatory is to see all sides, wouldn't be able to comprehend the one with out the other
				-but this is to understand the contrary of god, while ulyssees wants to understand the extremes of man through experience

	-how could a finite amount of suffering result in infinite bliss or damnation?
		-consider gates of hell - how could love be a product of wrongness, and why would this be love?  because its just - i.e. tough love/justice?  isn't love merciful?

	
	
how is man made in god's image?
	-does't make any sense - quote dante
		-but: we have intellect, and free will, dominion
			-seth made in image of adam
		-but we are completely different from god, who is infinite in all good ways (p.504, 505)
			-infinite is what divides us from god?
	-at end, dante finds out that this is unknowable, and he stops trying
		-but even his poem is constructed in such a way to create this ambiguity
			-this is why the geometer is a such a good example - first trying to solve it, then stepping back and realizing it is unsolvable because the infinite cannot fit into the finite

	-"at this point power failed high fantasy" - what power, whose power?
		-is he giving up his power?  
		-power failed my high fantasy? (whose power, his own, or god's? - gods power couldn't be comprehended by dante's high fantasy, because it is unknowable, or his own power can't comprehend his own high fantasy - i.e. he can understand the un-understandable)

	"but, like a wheel in perfect balance turning, I felt my will and my desire impelled by the Love that moves the sun and the other stars"
		-will & desire in the divine comedy
			-end of desire & will, what has characterized every sphere of heaven (see start of 33, p.406, 513) 
		-passivity
			-passivity in augustine, plotinus(?) - greatest gift to god is to give up free will
				-giving up will is to give up desire => aquinas quote
				-connection between intellect & desire

	-what was it that made this question the one in which dante becomes "enlightened"?  Why does the poet end the book here with this question after seeing god?  Is this the most mysterious passage of the bible?  Ranking with it is "Iam what I am" & jesus: "I am".  This definitly seems as though it is the cause of all mysteries in the bible, for if we could explain this divide between god & man, then we could explain how & why we are different from god and yet the same, i.e. how we are both made in his image and yet in no way comparable

	-is this the only way we can comprehend god (through a loss of self, through loss of desire) - it is a contentment in not knowing (rationally) but a feeling of god's presence 
		-this was eve's original sin -> wanting to understand, be like god


-function of mystery?  This seems to be the basic interaction when man looks up at god. this is true both in the old & new testamnet - the creation story, the wresting match, jonah, job, and jesus' parables
	does this suggest some unity which is essential to god which man can't grasp on his own because of his dual intelect? consider:
		-adam created, which mean's "man" - collective
		the trinity , i.e 3=1
		the fall, with a god & a devil - when was the devil/serpent created?
		both adam & eve - only after eve came along was it that the sin was commited, and by adam's opposite.  could speculate on how long adam was around before eve - i.e. if it was just chance that he hadn't commited the sin before she came?
		unity of wills, passivity
		the tree - knowledge of good & evil
		the chosen (jew) vs. gentile
		the first thing in creation - creating the world & the firmament (i.e god & the world(separation from god - the devil being the most separate, at the center of the earth), ?i.e. good & evil?)
		passivity, i.e. loss of will, and loss of self when becoming one with god.  those in purgatory would have to lose themselves, i.e. what defined them, ex: pride, lust - i.e. lose their desire.  does desire define someone? 
		collective guilt for isreal, for original sin, collective redemption for man through christ (i.e. unity in group of people opposed to judging each individual on their own merits)		
		salvation being universal

		those willing to die for me will have eternal life  (find quote in bible) - metaphorical dying, not dying of body, but dying of ego/will?
			-connection between intellect & desire - individual realizes he is worth nothing, and can know nothing truly.  that he is naked, and not ashamed.
		
		how exactly is freedom attained through loss of one's self, will, desire?  We normally say we are free when we can do what we desire, but here the most free is separate from the individual - (Par. Canto 3, Purg. Canto 28)


		

could this unity be something like plotinus is describing it:
The good or the one:
	4. When the soul knows something, it loses its unity; it cannot remain simply one because knowledge implies discursive reason and discursive reason implies multiplicity.  The soul then misses The One and falls into number and multiplicity."
	6.  Hence the One cannot aim at any good or desire anything: it is superior to the good; it is the good, nor for itself, but for other things to the extent Becuase it is the cause of good it cannot, then, to which they can share in it"
	Because it is the cause of good it cannot, then be called the Good; yet in another sense it is the Good above all".
	7. "it mujst not even know that it is itself that is applhying itself to contemplation of the one" (i.e. ego loss)
	10: (passivity, loss of ego) "Actually, we should not say, 'he will see'  What he sees (in case it is still possible to distinguish here the seer and the seen, to assert that the two are one would be indeed rash) is not seen, not distinguished, not represented as a thing apart.  The man who obtains the visision becomes, as it were, another being.  He ceases to be himself, retains nothing of himself.  They become two only when they separate.  It is in this sense that we can speak of the one as something separate.
11.  "In that state he had attained unity, nothing whin him or without effecting diversity.  When he had made his ascent, there was within him no disturbance, no anger, emotion, desire, reason or though.  Actually, he was no longer himself; but, swept away and filled with the divine, he was still, solitary, and at rest, not turning to this side or that or even towards himself...He had risen above beauty, had passed beyond even the choir of virtues."







don't know where/how/if this fits in / random thoughts:

separation between reason, skill and faith - virgil & beatrice
		how does pleasure fit in to this?  - isn't this what adam & eve had in the garden
		sounds hedonistic, but is it to say the only true pleasure is in being passive and fulfilling his will through love?


Plotinus: 7: Having thus freed itself of all externals, the soul must turn totally inward; not allowing itself to be wrested back towards the outer, it must forget everything, the subjective first and finally, the objective
This divinity, it is said, is not outside any being but, on the contrary, is present to all beings though they may not know it.  They are fugitives from the divine, or rather from themselves.  What they turn from they cannot reach.  Themselves lost, they can find no other.  A son distraught and besides himself is not likely to recognizse his father.  But the man who has learned to know himself will at the same time discover whence he comes.

maybe our brains, for whatever reason (survival, from the fruit of the tree), are structed in such a way as to be dual - meaning we need to understand evil to understand good. (see augustine - names of god)  this would mean adam & eve did not know god.  the fall was simply a way for god to allow us to know him.  but maybe our brains were changed.  the question is why adam & eve would be turned to sin - if they were fixated on god, why would they want to turn away? why would adam need another human if he were content on seeing god?  certainly dante couldn't get his eyes away from god, or even a lower being, beatrice.  but he had already experienced the depths of hell.
	thaeteatus - "evil is of necessity, for there must be a contrary to good' (taken from plotinus)


romans 11.32 - "god has emersed all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all".

knowledge is the opposite of mystery - it is needing to be comfortable in being able to grasp something
	-this need may be the center of all needs, all desires, hence those in heaven are wrapped by mystery, and totally content without knowing, without reasoning.  and this need is central to all on earth, which is why man desires to know

Dante completely captured by beauty of beatrice -> loss of ego quote?  -> plotinus, like losing yourself when reading a book
