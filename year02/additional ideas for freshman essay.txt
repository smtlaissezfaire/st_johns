increase & multiply - p.332 - this is where we get "faculty and power both to articulate ...something we have grasped in a signle way in our minds, and to interpret in many different senses something we read"



do not appear to be in image of god - we are sinners - quote dante, also p.70 of augustine

says that he has made us in his image and likeness.  afterwords give dominion
dominion could be the way
dominion also implies free will, intellection, and would otherwise being meaningless
				**for augustine, this intellection is a type of prayer and is a way for him to be lead back to god
						*************************************				quote contemplation - > creation of images in our mind, in the same way god creates by speaking or thinking

confusion over distinction between image & likeness
-different or same? augustine no distinction
-could be that likeness is saying that man is more like god than the other created objects
	-this would explain why it is said "man has become *like* us", and the devil said this as well
-and yet this is what separates us from god - knowledge of good and evil
-was this the sin? knowing good & evil?
PRIDE

	-we were made like god, yet we are not on his level.  was the original sin wanting to be like god?
	-we also see this with the tower of babel - they were trying to conquer god
	-might have been a stooping down to level of flesh - a focus not on The Good but some lesser good
	-augustine & pear tree - seemed to be a parallel.  not only was he stealing a fruit like a & e that did not belong to him, it was also a sign of the double will.  desired good, but not THE GOOD.  Heart was not in the right place - p.32
	augustine seems to think that its our attachment to this world - to the flesh, i.e. our pride is what has brought us to "death's door", and hence he joins the manichees, who he calls incredibly prideful




inward knowledge as the only way to the truth

attempts are through neo-platonist meditation - this is what he does until he reaches the garden
-first experiencce - first contact with god - knew what god was, as opposed to some figment of imagination p138
	-plotinus says words of god, but in convoluted manner
	-unlikeness augustine says
	-solves problem of evil which has been bugging his soul - not a coincidence that this happens directly afterward
-second experience - experiences that which is
	-gives method for dissolving pride - his method towards god up until this point
	-yet pride still exists, and he cannot continue with connection to god for long.
		-does he surpass the pride during this religious experience?
		-method seems the same as transcending the sins of man - 
			i.e. 	lust - earthly objects and things
			 	discursive reason - pride in rhetoric, ideas
				then that which is -> afterlife=eternal life + knowledge of god (where is this?)

	-not coincidental that he recognizes need for a mediator between god and man - christ
	-he was too prideful to see Jesus as this mediator (p140)
		somehow pride blocks the Truth from entering our life - see p. 317 - maybe this is because we can't see the need for christ, a mediator?
		said he got the book of the platonists from a man "grossly swollen with pride" p131
		even if they know God, they do not honor him as God or give him thanks..in claiming to be wise they have become stupid" p 131


************************************p.137 - its not a turning inward, although this is a necessary first step.  the second step is transcendence, which is a removal of the self - p. 137

knowledge of self to truth-> p138 "I heard it as one hears a word in the heart, and no possibility of doubt remained to me; I could more easily hav doubted that I was alive than that truth exists, truth that is seen and understood through the thigs that are made.

p134 -> it was exaulted because this very light made me, and I was below it because by it I was made.  Ayone who knows truth knows it, and whoever knows it knows eternity.  Love knows it.

must reach into inner most being because this is the only way one knows god - truth, eternity, love - mysterious connection


-third experience in the garden - is to be takent that this what plotinic ecstasy? 
	no - although same method of meditation may have been used   it is now a shift from knowledge (certanty of god's existence) of god to practical actionp141 

in this way it is not a pure knowledge of god 



DOUBLE WILL
2 wills - 
-this is the only thing that austine really attributes to the fall - everything else he blames himself for
all of this is because of a divided will?  was the will divided before or after the fall?  augustine: after the fall.  then what caused eve & adam to disobey? their will was not divided, so  was it already turned towards evil?
	evil doesn't really exist for augustine - everything in creation is good, but to varying degrees.  since everything came from god, nothing can be truely evil (complete absense of good) 
	so they must have been turned to some middle of the spectrum - not towards god (the ultimate good) nor towards evil (or an infitesimly close absense of good), rather towards some middle/mean.
	the free will's first decision then was towards evil
	original sin as habit - but willing habit - p.155
	original sin is not given great weight - augustine says that he has freely chosen to act against god since birth.  he is as much responsible for it as adam is.  it is not because of adam that he acts this way.
	but: "I was at odds with myself, and fragmenting myself.  This disintegration was occuring without my consent, but what it indicated was not the presence in me of a mind belonging to some alient nature but the punishment undergone by my own.  In this sense, and this sense only, it was not I who brought it about, but the sin that dwelt within me as a penalty for that other sin commited with greater freedom; for I was a son of Adam." p.164
**this is still a question to determine - how much emphesis augstine puts on original sin - is it only this divided will?  the discussion of children seems to imply that children choose actively to be disobedient both to their parents and to god - in general to act evil - do they only do this because of original sin?  augustine is constantly saying what a miserable wretch he is - but if all of this inherited, what fault is there to see in man?  this seems to be common among wise men - they blame themselves (they also put the blame where it is due) - maybe this is because of some interconnectedness of all things (that's not to go into the essay, just mindless speculation)***

p.153-55 - we naturally chose lust -> forms habit -> is this the only thing that divides our will?
	one will carnal, the other spiritual"the law of sin is that brute ofrce of habit whereby the mind is dragged along and held fast against its will.."

body is easy to will by mind, but mind willing mind is difficult -> command comes from divided mind ->
	two wills one of body, the other of mind


in chp. 8, augustine is starting to make the voyage from thought to action - see. 162 "the faculty to act and the will to act precisely coincide, and the willing is alredy the doing"& 
p.145
likeness might imply a unity within ourselves as a will, and this is what allows us to grasp the truth in some way - and now we cannot only contemplate the divine thought with our one will, but act godly with the other
	but since we (and all things) exist to a degree (because we have a degree of goodness - a degree of god in us) 




******************* What's up with the pear tree!!!***********************************

And so our specific possibilities in terms of likeness and image to god include intellect, will, being, the trinity within ourselves, and the dominion that we have over the created creatures of the earth and the earth itself.  Dominion, because we rule over the earth in a similar way that God rules over the created objects; intellect, because of our dominion, we are able to make free choices and have free will; being, because everything that is existing is somewhat in the image of god or has somelikeness (for otherwise it would not exist) and hence goodness; will, because like God we can work from an undivided mind; and finally the trinity within ourselves, just as God is a trinity, and yet a unity.





-isn't everything made in the image of god?  everything is good (even if to varying degrees)

-augustine also suggests that we understand the trinity in a fundamental way through intellect, will, being -p.134
	"can anyone comprehend the almight trinity?" - this is ultimately the same problem as if we are in the image of god.  the problem is that when we speak of god, do we really know what we are speaking about? (quote) if we don't, then how can we speak of being in the image of god?  -p.312 "who can find any way to express this truth?  Who dare make any assertion about it?" (only the proud)
	-maybe this is why we must turn inward instead of turning outside. 
	we must first turn outward, then inward, then transcend our inwardness - plotinus, augustine (outward turning towards creation
	p.134 - "with the vision of my spirit, I saw the incommutable light far above my spiritaual ken, transcending my mind"
	
p. 5 - "what does anyone who speaks of you really say?"
	seems that augustine only knows God through the Holy Spirits presence in our life.  all purely intellectual knowing is not a true knowing its only a knowing with part of our being
we can only know god truely if we submit our whole being - our own trinity so to speak, (see p139), and this cannot be innumerated in words - what does anyone who speaks of you really say? But continues: yet woe betide those who fail to speak
	if we cannot truely pin down what God is (at least verbally) nor what the complete absense of good is (because it does not exist), then how can we say what his image is?  How can we say how we were made in his image?

	augustine: "No, for you, O god, did not say, Let there be man, according to his kind", but Let us make man according to our image and likeness, for you meant us to discern your will for ourselves
	image - as everything in creation is
	likeness - our ability to determine our will and tame it to the good

different ideas:  intellect, dominion, will (once we have aligned our separate wills, being (everythig that exists is in the image of god)

but I cannot say that i know that god meant something different by the terms image and likeness or if they are equivocal.  it is also not clear to me if after the fall we had lost our likeness to god, although this seems unprobable.  maybe augutine was suggesting that we only inherit this likeness to god by aligning our separate wills to his, and in this way, since we have this ability, then we always have the potential to be like god.  I have no way of refuting augustine's claim that everything is good - hence everything is in the image of god.  therefore, when god says that we are in his image, the only thing that this might imply is that we are created more like his image than the other created beings.

and still unnlikeness beause of our degree of existence - see p 135
but do we transcend to a greater existance, one of god, once we have not only had the plotonic ecstacy but also his thing in the garden - a shift from knowledge/certainty of god to action ?




problems, etc:

**odd "sin" with the pear tree** - out of the catagory of normal sins - does this pose a problem with his problem of evil?
if it is just about getting the right idea, and changing habituation, this would mean that our natural state is one of a godly life - and in this way, we are like him; but then again augustine seems his sinful state as natural - from birth.  and so in this way are disimilar from him




not included:

freedom - does freedom mean unifying the wills?  no longer being jerked around by two separate wills? if so, then we are free to decide the way that god decides.  

what separates us from god is what can also bring us closer to god - parallels between pear tree, fruits of spirit, enlightenement in garden, fruit of spirit.
	-before knowledge of good and evil, a & e couldn't appreciate what it is they had lost
	-and yet this is what causes us to desire the supreme good
	-see p. 150-51, think of story of prodigal son







When we say that man is made in God’s image, we do not take it to mean that are crafted like God in terms of appearance.  Yet some assume this because Seth was taken in the image of Adam, and further some think that something that has no physical being does not really exist.  Hence some have come to believe that if they do not take God’s image to mean a physical image, then they would be left with nothing, -> quote augustineinvalidating God’s existence.  Yet we believe that God is the creator of matter, of the physical things in this world.  He is beyond matter. ->augustine


So in what way can we say we are made in his image?  Dominion, free will, and intellection, which are all related, (for to have dominion, both free will and intellection are required), seem to be the way in which this phrase is meant.  And it is for this reason that God says “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea…”

But I am confused as to whether there is some distinction between image and likeness.  The reason that I am confused about this is that in 1.26 God says “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.” But after the fall, God says, “The man has [only now] become like one of us, knowing good and evil” – implying that man was only made in his likeness after the fall.  This is to say that even though man was created in god’s image, he was not created in his likeness.  So does likeness refer to the fact that, like God, we have knowledge of good and evil?  Or do both image and likeness refer to the intellect?

But it is clear that we have dominion, which is a judging function of man.  Man’s judging only errs when Adam & Eve eat of the fruit of the tree.  This acquired knowledge of good and evil is what separates God from man, and hence the casting out of man from the garden.  Why is knowledge of good and evil what separates man from God?  Or is there another cause?  The tricky thing is the confusion that I have already related concerning likeness.  If this knowledge causes us to be like God, how does this then separate us from him?

If this is not the cause of our separation from God, then the real cause of the fall may be pride in our own will and judgment.  It seems as though man has only one will – that of his own.  But within his will, he can either actively will (as we do normally) or passively will.  The passive will is a function of the active will: it is the active will which actively renounces itself, now agreeing to follow another’s will and desires.  It is clear that Adam & Eve follow their own will and actively disobey God’s will.  Could this be the cause of the fall and the sin that is the cause of all other sins (a pride in one’s self and one’s own will)?  Is this then to say that anything which one will actively will, will of necessity be evil or contrary to God?

There is another question that connects to that of the will.  What is meant when one speaks of freedom?  Often we speak of freedom as having the ability to carry out our own will.  Yet Augustine, Dante, Plotinus, etc. speak of freedom as only occurring when one is no longer obeying one’s own will, but rather God’s.  When such authors speak of freedom do they mean a freedom from (earthly) desires?  Even with this freedom, we are still not free in the truest sense – we have just become a slave to a new thing.  Yet this (God) is the highest of all things.  Is this to say that we are enslaved, but as free as one can become?  Or is it a different type of freedom?  

This freedom is described as only occurring when one turns inward and becomes passive; only when one neglects their own free will do they see God.  What is it that allows us to see the divinity only in this method?  And how exactly does this process occur?  Or is this method not exclusive?  Are there other methods to seeing the divinity?

The central question comes back: How are we related to God – how are we made in his image and likeness?  For Augustine this method of questioning seems to be his only way to get at this question and all questions that regard God’s seemingly contradictory nature.  There is something fundamental about his inward turning, his self-examination, his reasoning through his own questions.  This is Augustine’s way towards this freedom, this lack of pride and will which was previously described.  I think this method directly connects to the question of how man is made in God’s image, but I am not sure that I can clearly explain this connection just yet.

So these are the central questions that I am struggling with, and those that I help to clear up with the rereading of the Confessions.
