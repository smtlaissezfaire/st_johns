Sophomore First Semester Oral Topic



I would like to talk about the nature of the trinity, especially as revealed in the Gospel of John.  More than any of the other works we have read from the Bible, this seems divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit; this seems obvious to me, yet I don't know what the Holy Spirit even is!  I am particularly intrigued with the first few lines of John, and the corresponding translation from Greek.  There seems to be multiple senses in which this could be taken in Greek, but this is never (from my own experience) translated into English.  It is the logos and arke which John mentions in the first line of which I hope to be of focus, and the understanding of God and/or his Son through reason or logos.
