Interchange between ISM & A. - ISM emphesizes thinking, while A. goes with her heart.  A later says that she is a creature of love, although this may be questioned.  She may just be looking for honor from either humans or from the gods.

Creon is worried about earthly laws, while ISM. is worried about godly laws, or at least so she says.  Her motives can be questioned.

Does A. think the laws of the gods are the same as fate?

Antigone openly admits that no one can know the laws of the gods.  So why does she think she will be honered by the gods by obeying their laws if she openly admits that she cannot know what they are?

Creon is on a power trip both with Haimon(p.211) and as a ruler.  he gets off on subordinating people.  This must mean that he needs to put others down to sustain his own self worth.  Are/should the laws of the gods be this way?  This clearly shows that even if the laws of the gods are not superior to the laws of man, that the laws of the gods are motivated by good intentions (honor, justice) where the laws of men are with a more person, self satisfying to the ruler.  Mentions "Showing himself weak" before breaking his word.

the death that can be escaped could be refuring to Antigone's death through execution.  Yet neither Antigone nor Creon devise plans to escape death.  It is clear, though, that Antigone does not care to escape death, and understands that man cannot escape judgement by the gods.  But creon can't escape death either - both the distruction of his rule and his own happiness (p.232) "Who can say that a man is still alie when his life's joy fails?  he is a walking dead man"

If the ode to man is talking of Creon it is being sarcastic in listing his accomplishments.  For he hasn't accomplished anything yet (I believe), but it is also being true in stating his limitations, and fating his downfall.


Spark notes:
The second choral ode begins on an optimistic note but becomes darker toward the end. This ode celebrates the “wonder” of man, but the Greek word for wonderful (deinon) has already been used twice in the play with the connotation of horrible or frightening (the messenger and Chorus use it to describe the mysterious burial of the body). The Chorus seems to praise man for being able to accomplish whatever goal he sets his sights on—crossing the sea in winter, snaring birds and beasts, taming wild horses. But the point of the ode is that while man may be able to master nature by developing techniques to achieve his goals, man should formulate those goals by taking into consideration the “mood and mind for law,” justice, and the common good. Otherwise, man becomes a monster.


It is no coincidence that Antigone enters directly after, and that Antigone has the dialogue with Creon.  See p.203

its also a bridge between Ismene changing her views.  And for Antigone to go against her sister, which is following in the line of Oedipus vs. his father and Etocles vs. Polynices

The ode after the ode to man can also be compared.  (p210) Beyond forshadowing the death of Antigone which the first choral ode did, it also foreshadows the judgement of Creon  it says "Fortunate is the man who has never tasted god's vengeance!" And then gives many plenty of symbols of nature, nature taking over man in contrast to the first ode.  "what mortal arrogance transcends the wrath of Zeus?" "Fate works most for woe..Man's little pleasure is the spring of sorrow"

orgas - order, anger.  suggesting ambiguity not often captured in english, and a mocking of man

after ode to man, praising his ability to keep free from the elements, the guards report a storm (p. 201)

but antigone in some way corrects the ode, allowing man to use death to his own ability to honor himself instead of being the plight of his demise.

is the ode saying that we should have a blend of religious and political ideas in our laws?  If so, then both creon and Antigone are not doing what is right, for they both seem to be extremes.  But Antigone may be pointing in the right direciton.
reason - double edged sword




structure of ode to man in relation to the rest of the play

highly ironical and ambiguous

literal:
-man has used his mind to create amazing things to protect from the elements
-mesh netting of thought - both translation and actual greek
-the ode is also a bridge bewteen ism. changing her views
-antigone goes against her sister, following fate and what is common in her line.
	-Is she betrayed by ISM?  Is that the only reason that she doesn't accept her taking the blame?  or is she concerned with her own honor being lessened?
	-fate seems to be ambiguous.  It compels, but yet there is that quote about having chosen your own destiny

-but highly ironical
-even though man has protected himself from the elements to a certain degree, he cannot fully
-relation to next ode
-windstorm right after
-polla ta deiva - ambiguous use of deiva
-ambiguous use or orgas
-talking of both antigone and creon
- what is the death they are speaking of?
	-a. tries to escape death, or to take control of it.  in this way she proves wrong what the ode says about man not being able to control death, although it is in a passive sense
	-creon's sense
	-sarcastic in listing his accomplishments

-what is the ode saying of political vs. religious/goddly laws?  antigone & creon are representing opposites, both fixated.  the ode seems to want a mix of these
-is Ant. really worried about godly laws, and not just earthly honor?  the people support her in their souls, but do not act on it because of creon's mighty hand.
	-what is the difference between gods laws, being honored by the gods, and being honored by man, and fate
	-A. does have a death wish, but only in so much as that she believes it is her only way to honor.
	-but antigone says: laws of gods are unknowable, so how can even she serve them
	-possible motives: honor by gods, giving in to fate, honor by man, honor by the dead
-is creon really worried about manly laws, and not just power?
	-power trip
	-is somewhat concerned with gods laws, but very mildly
	-decree was made to antigone, and really no one else
	-creon wanting to separate himself (from the fate, and antigone's ways of respecting god's laws) and be close at the same time to oedipus' line for power

-so it seems as though the serface meanings of the main charachters (antigone and creon) are noble, simply with different focuses, but the ode to man shows through ambiguous language how they are not, yet allows for an ambiguous view of the two charachters
