imitation is how humans learn, and what they have over animals ch 4

all art is done for happiness, because it stimulates the intellect - ch 4 - learning is the greatest of pleasures not only to the philosopher but also to the rest of man kind

ch 6 - incidents arousing pity and fear, wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions - are these the only elements that arouse catharsis?  Is this what we want to gain - a relief at the end?  How does this stimulate the intellect?  

ch 6.II - tragedy is essentially an imitation not of persons but of action and life, of hapiness and misery - the end of which we live is a certain kind of activity, not a quality.  charachter gives us qualities

ch 8 - poetry must imitate one thing, one action as a complete whole

ch 9 - poetry is concerned with universals instead of singulars.  universal statement - what such or such a kind of man will probably or necessarily say or do - which is the aim of poetry (i.e. action)

 - probablity & necessity key - this is because of action, and this is an end

tragedy imitation of not only a complete action, but also of incidents arousing pity and fear.  greatest effects on the mind when unexpectedly and in consequence of one another.  must have meaning, for this is how it ties in to probablity & necessity - i.e. cause and effect, which is action - which is the end of man

ch 11 - peripety arouses pity or fear

ch 13 - "must imitate actions arousing fear and pity, since that is the distinctive function of this kind of imitation."  

cannot be a good man from hapiness to misery - not fear inspiring or piteous, but simply odious 
cannot be a bad man from misery to hapiness - not tragic at all because it does not appeal to the human feeling in us, or to our pity or fears
cannot be a bad man falling from hapiness into misery - may arouse human feeling, but will not move us to either pity or fear

pity - occasioned by undeserved misfortune
fear - by that one like ourseves - see ch 14 - family

perfect plot - single issue, change in hero's fortunes must be from hapiness to misery, cause must not lie in depravity, but in some great depravity - man must be better than we are, or equal to us, for there is nothing tragic in seeing a lesser fall or be happy

ch 14 - better to arouse fear & pity through structure of play than through spectacle, for this shows better causality, i.e. imitation - and "only the proper pleasure of trajedy should be required"

tragic pleasre is that of pity and fear, and the poet has to produce it by a work of imitation, it is clear, therefore, that the causes should be included in the incidents of his story

incedent of horror - friend must do deed to friend - family - why antigone starts with koinon

"the worst situation is when the personage is with full knowledge on the point of doing the deed, and leaves it undone" - this is because of lack of imitation, i.e. reason - odious and untragic; hence no one acts this way, except for Haemon and Creon in Antigone - 
	this brings up a question of classification for me - when something doesn't fit, does one just take it as an annomaly, a rule which can be broken?  Would this just subtract a small element of tragedy from a tragic play?  Or is Aristotle misclassifying this?



imitation - reason - hapiness

pity & fear + (human feeling?) = tragedy - why does tragedy create hapiness?  How does it stimulate the intellect?  If it is just for catharsis, how does this stimulate the intelect? 

The basic emotions are happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprise and disgust. 



the purpose of a trajedy
-all art done for hapiness, i.e. intelect
- tragedy is an inimitation not of persons but of action and life - hapiness & misery is end for which we live
-necessity is key, universals, and so is having only one action as a complete whole - this must be ordered, for this must be what stimulates the intelect
-all art is done as imitation, and the best is for a complete whole, so good tragedies do this, but must have pity and fear, for this is "the distinctive function of this kind of imitation"
-what makes pity and fear essential to defining trajedy?
	-what sort of man it takes
-must be able to relate and empathize with characthers - must be able to see as a greater - 
	-is this another element - "human feeling" that aristotle does not emphasize?  why not?  is it that it is common to all art?  this seems to be something that we have over animals, but does this arrise happiness and contemplation?
	-family, antigone
-cause of pity & fear 
-emotion seems to be devided into two catagories - positive and negative.  many emotions are simply synonms or combinations of these basic emotions or nuances:
happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprise and disgust. i.e. 

positive: happy
negative: sad, anger, fear, disgust

with peripity/surpise accompaning either catagory, and intensifying it

i.e. timid - fear and lack of self worth, causing sadness
i.e. worry - fear
i.e. pity - undiserved misfortune, causing sadness and possibly anger, fear, or disgust

although all of these emotions are expressed in the play, it is what is evoked in the crowd which counts.  

it does not make any sense for the play to be uplifting - then it is not tragedy.  so hapiness is ruled out.  only account is that pity encompeses sadness, while anger and disgust at the play would not be stimulating to the intelect.  To cause the audience to feel angry at one or all of the characters at the end would not stimulate the intellect, and neither would disgust.  "All human happiness or misery takes the form of action; the end for which we live is a certain kind of activity, not a quality"  how could anger lead to contemplation?

both of these emotions, pity & fear work together, pity to feel sad for the charachters, fear by allowing the audience to feel at one with the charachter, thinking that such a situation could happen.  but this is necessitated by having reason to feel pity.  These two cause reflection on one's own life, where anger and disgust do not, or at least to a lesser degree.

-perfect plot
-tragic pleasure - pity & fear - by imitation - this is how we originally learn, and learning causes contemplation, which is the greatest hapiness, and all men desire to know, therfore desire to be happy.  One of the arts, tragedy causes learning through negative emotion - pity and fear
	-"tragic pleasure" - pleasure through vicarious misery? do we only obtain hapiness through contemplation ? or through catharsis as well- relief at the end of the play?  what 
relief does one get at the end of Antigone, or Oedipus Rex?  "the best of all is the last; where Merope, on the point of slaying her son, recognizes him in time" ch 14
what relief do we get when this is not the case?  is this why this latter situation is so desirable?

-still don't understand:  still not certain about pity & fear, if those are the only emotions which can provoke contemplation, because even anger and disgust can provoke contemplation (usually after the fact).  not sure if my classification of emotions work, catharis' role in play, what the "human feeling is defined as"
