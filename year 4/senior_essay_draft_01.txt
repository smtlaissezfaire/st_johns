"Contrary to the opinion of Legendre, all other imperfections [of Euclidean Geometry]- for example, the definition of a straight line - show themselves foreign here and without any real influence."

A Short Story on One Student's Encounter

When the student initially encounters Lobechevsky, he is amazed and yet perplexed at this new world.  "Please extend those straight parallel lines," he requests.  Since Lobechevsky is no where to be found, the student himself extends the lines, only to find himself drawing one of them as curved.  How can he reconcile the fact that he must draw this object as curved, and yet see it as straight?  He knows sight is no mathematical proof, but yet the student feels the contradiction.  Contrary to Lobechevsky's claim, it appears that straightness has actually changed.

So the student labours in vain to find the most conclusive absurdity, a reductio ad absurdum to disprove this non-sense once and for all.  "Obviously the straight line is what has changed; the contradiction _must_ be in it," the student thinks to himself.  And how does labor, generating theorem after theorem, only to lose hope once and again
